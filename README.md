## 🎯 What is ADE?

**ADE** is an **Autonomous AI Development Assistant** that doesn't just respond to commands - it **thinks independently**, **plans execution strategies**, and **orchestrates multiple tools** to solve complex tasks. Built with LangChain and Google Gemini, it combines autonomous reasoning with real-time web intelligence.

### ⚡ **Quick Demo**
```bash
$ python -m src.main

🧠 You: Create a weather app for Mumbai and test it
ADE: [🧠 Thinking: User wants weather app → Need file creation + API integration + testing]

     1. 📝 Creating weather_app.py with Mumbai weather API...
     2. 🌐 Fetching real-time Mumbai weather data...
     3. ✅ Testing application with live data...
     
     🌤️ Mumbai Weather: 29°C, Partly Cloudy
     ✅ Created: weather_app.py (functional weather application)
```

## 🌊 How It Works

### **1. Autonomous Intelligence Flow**
```
User Query → AI Analysis → Strategic Planning → Tool Orchestration → Execution → Results
```

### **2. Real-time Web Intelligence**
```
Query → Type Detection → Multi-Source Scraping → Data Aggregation → Formatted Response
```

### **3. Memory & Learning** 
```
Interaction → Context Storage → Vector Embedding → Semantic Retrieval → Enhanced Responses
```
